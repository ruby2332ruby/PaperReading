Elsken et al. JMLR 2019.  

# Poblem Definition
## [1] Assumption and Goal
Deep Learning often progress because someone design a **novel neural architectures**. Currently employed architectures have mostly been developed manually by human experts, which is a time-consuming and error-
prone process. More and more people getting interest in **automated neural architecture search methods**.  

## [2] Novelty and Contribution
* Provide an overview of existing work in this field of research.  
* Categorize them according to three dimensions:  
    1. search space
    2. search strategy
    3. performance estimation strategy

## [3] Promising Application(未來應用)

# Technical Summary

## [1] Neural Architecture Search (NAS)
**Neural Architecture Search** is the process
of automating architecture engineering. NAS can be
seen as subfield of AutoML and has significant overlap with hyperparameter optimization and meta-learning.  
NAS methods have outperformed manually designed architectures on some tasks. (image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation)  

## [2] Categorize Methods for NAS
Categorize methods for NAS according to three dimensions:  
1. **Search Space:** The search space defines which architectures can be represented
in principle.
