# Poblem Definition
## Assumption and Goal
**Generative probability models** such as hidden Markov models provide a principled way of treating missing information and dealing with variable length sequences.  
**Discriminative methods** such as support vector machings enable us to construct flexible decision boundaries and ofter result in classification performance superior to that of the medel based approaches.  
本篇提出在推導discriminative methods的kernel funciton時，利用generative probability models的特性，達到結合上述兩種方法的優點。  
**(提出了Fisher Kernel)**  
## Novelty and Contribution
* 對於新提出的classifier有詳細的理論證明與實驗結果
* a substantial improvement in the classification performance in the context of DNA and protein sequence analysis.  

## Promising Application
* Provide a better way to construct a Discriminative Classifiers.  
* Propose a general method for extracting discriminatory features using a generative medol. (with kernel methods)

# Method/Technical Summary

## Kernel Methods
The label for a new example X obtained from a weighted sum of the training labels (binary label).  
The weighting of each training label Si consists of two parts:  
1. the overall importance of the example Xi as summarized with a coefficient lambda i
2. a measure of pairwise "similarity" between Xi and X, expressed in terms of a kernel function K(Xi, X)

## Generalized Linear Models
* 以logistic regression models為例。

* then maximizimg the following penalized log-likelihood.

* and the solution form will be like this:

* Inserting the above solution back into the conditional probability model gives:

* However, as long as the examples here can be replaced with feature vectors derived from the examples, this form of the kernel function is the most general.  

## The Kernel Function

* **valid**: needs to be semi-definite.

## The Fisher Kernel
**為本篇提出的重要概念**  

Fisher Kernel is the kernels derived from generative probability models.  
It enhancing the discriminative power of the model and find a natural comparison between examples induced by the generative medel.

## Dataset
* 9350 DNA fragments from *C.elegans* collected by Jonathon King of the Sanger Centre and Arun Jagota at UCSC.

# Discussion
* For discrimination, the resulting combined classifier is guaranteed to be superior to the generative model along with little additional computational cost.  
* It is possibel to ue there features with any classifier.  
* We can use classification to huide the development of the kernel function, the results are directly applicable to regerssion, clustering, or even interpolation problems.  

## Question
* How to apply Fisher Kernel on a feedforward neural net?
